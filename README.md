How It Works:

User Input: Recipes: Comma-separated list (e.g., "bread, sandwich, burger")
Ingredients: Semicolon-separated lists for each recipe, with ingredients comma-separated (e.g., "yeast, flour; bread, meat; sandwich, cheese").
Supplies: Comma-separated list of what you already have.

Processing:

Builds a dependency graph (ingredient â†’ recipes).
Uses indegree logic (how many ingredients each recipe needs).
Enqueues supplies, and as dependencies are resolved, enqueues recipes that become makeable.

Output:

Displays the final list of recipes you can make, based on chained dependencies.
